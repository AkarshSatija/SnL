Snakes and Ladders


Task:

Create and implement the classical  snakes & ladders game, for two players, consists of 5 X 5 grid board with 3 snakes, 3 ladders and a roll-dice button using html, css &  js/jquery.
Snakes are positioned at 22 - 4, 17 - 8, 11 - 2 and ladders are positioned at 5 - 16, 9 - 20, 14 - 23
On clicking the roll-dice button,the player1/player2 should be moved to the required position on the board and if it encounters a snake or a ladder, the message should appear and the player should be moved to the destined position. The player who reaches 25 first, wins the game and the game ends.

Note:
The ui need not to be very fancy, a simple ui would suffice. 
The js programming should follow the OOPS concepts.
Try to keep your code original as much as possible.
